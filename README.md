# Soteria
By Coen Adler, Harsh Jha, Giridhar Vadhul, and Shreya Sinha

## What is Soteria?
Soteria is a safety first navigation application. In simple words, Soteria takes a start and end location and outputs the safest walking path to the destination. The program first aggregates a dataset of over 300,000 incident reports in Santa Cruz into a neo4j graphing database, where incident nodes are matched to nearby road intersections. A safety score for both the roads and intersections are calculated and the path that results with the lowest safety score is returned.

## Who are we?
We are first-year students at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Coen, Harsh, and Giridhar are pursuing degrees in Computer Science with Shreya pursuing Robotics Engineering. Our devotion to the growing community and well-being of others pushed us to undertake on this project.
